Four features, however, are most notable. First, absolutive deletion is related to the syllable weight of monosyllabic stems: cf. <i>kali</i> (‘house’) vs. <i>mi:l</i> (‘corn plant’). The long vowel in <i>*mi:lli</i> permits absolutive (<i>-li</i>) loss, whereas the short vowel of <i>kali</i> requires its maintenance (*<i>kalli</i> > <i>kali</i>). Second, younger speakers invariably drop stem-final vowels in a certain verbal class (cf. <i>pata:n</i> &#91;‘s/he/it flew’&#93;) whereas elders add the <i>-k</i> perfective marker: <i>pata:nik</i>. Third, perfective marking shifts depending on the “weight” of verbal stems: <i>kichi:wak</i> (‘s/he did it’) adds the <i>-k</i> whereas the greater weight of a reduplicated stem permits final-vowel loss: <i>kichihchi:w</i> (‘s/he made it’). Finally, two applicative forms are used depending on the referentiality of the object: <i>ne:chpa:kilia notlake:n</i> (‘s/he washes my clothes for me’) whereas <i>ne:chtapa:kia</i> (‘s/he washes &#91;clothes, non-referential&#93; for me’). </p>","<p>The Nahuatl spoken in the historically related communities of San Agustín Oapan, Ahuelicán, Analco, and Tula del Río, in the Balsas valley of central Guerrero, is tonal, having undergone tonogenesis from the effect of a laryngeal coda, *h, lost in Oapan and its offshoots (Analco and Tula del Río) but retained in Ahuelicán. Minimal pairs not found elsewhere have emerged: <i>xtlapalo</i> (‘sop it up’) with expected penultimate stress contrasts with <i>xtla<sup>H</sup>palo</i> (‘salute him/her’) with high tone from *h (cf. <i>xtlahpalo</i>) and stress shifted word finally. In Oapan high tone often precedes lost *h; in Ahuelicán these vowels are low and the *h is retained. Thus Oapan ta<sup>H</sup>ˈtli contrasts with Ahuelicán tah<sup>L</sup>ˈtli (‘father’); in both stress shifts rightward. Another unique innovation in these Balsas villages is reduplication manifested by vowel lengthening. Thus <i>tlatsotsona</i> ‘to play a stringed instrument’ is realized as <i>tla:tsona</i> (reduplicant <i>tso-</i> is replaced by lengthening of the verbal prefix <i>tla-</i>). Other innovations (see Library) occur that are unique to this small group of villages.</p>","<p>Nawat <code><a href='https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/pipi1250' target='_blank'>pipi1250</a></code>, the preferred autonym, is the southernmost Aztec language, spoken now only in western El Salvador.

It is now a critically endangered language, though recently revitalization efforts have been undertaken among the younger generation. Nawat is characterized by having the &#60;t&#62;, not &#60;tl&#62;, phoneme; <i>-t</i> is also the plural marker rather than the more expected <i>-h</i> and &#60;t&#62; appears in many contexts in which other Nahuatl languages manifest &#60;h&#62; (e.g., the plural perfective ending <i>-ket</i>. Nominal stems that end in &#60;l&#62; have lost the absolutive (hence <i>kal</i> ‘house’) and the erstwhile progressive ending <i>-tuk</i> (cf. <i>-tok</i> elsewhere) has a resultative and perfect sense in Nawat: <i>wa:ktuk</i> ‘it is dry’ and ‘it has dried’.</p>"]

Perfective verbs commonly use a low-tone prefix, <i>i-</i> or <i>ixi-</i> whereas the imperfective shows the common use of a high tone on the first mora, except in the case of motion verbs. Negation of the irrealis is marked by a mid-tone prefix (<i>i-</i> or <i>u- &#47;o-</i>) and a shift to a high tone on the first mora of the stem (affirmative irrealis aspect never has a high initial tone). This can be compared to the low-high tone of irrealis negation in other Mixtec languages. Otherwise negation is realized by a separate preverbal word: <i>kòó</i>. </p>","<p>Xochapa is a small Mixtec-speaking <code><a href='https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/xoch1238' target='_blank'>xoch1238</a></code> town located about 12 km southwest of Alcozauca in eastern Guerrero, just west of the Mixteca Baja in Oaxaca. Xochapa is little documented and most of the information is found in a small dictionary that is available in this sub-portal. However, a master’s thesis and in-process doctoral thesis by Juana Mendoza Ruiz on Alcozauca Mixtec, a very closely related language, describes the segmental and tonal phonology of Alcozauca and frequently compares this phonology to that of Xochapa and other nearby related languages such as Yoloxóchitl Mixtec. All three manifest four level tones, with an innovative low-mid tone not found in other Mixtec languages. </p>","<p>Yoloxóchitl Mixtec <code><a href='https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/yolo1241' target='_blank'>yolo1241</a></code> is a coastal language spoken in 4 communities in the municipality of San Luis Acatlán: Yoloxóchitl, Arroyo Cumiapa, Buena Vista, and Cuanacaxtitlán. The variations pose almost no challange to intervillage communication although tone sandhi (in this case, a floating high tone) occurs in Cuanacaxtlan though absent in the other communities. Yoloxóchitl Mixtec is characterized by a relatively high level of compounding, apparently not as common in other Mixtec languages, and an extensive tonal inventory. Common tones in the Mixtec spoken in the Yoloxóchitl include 4 level, 3 rising, and 2 falling tones. Contour tones such as 143 (low.high.mid) are much rarer. A few additional patterns are generated by final person-marking enclitics. As a result, the number of tonal contrasts in bimoraic words can be very high. For example, the segmental sequence nama manifests 26 distinct tonal patterns and 30 words (including 4 homonyms). </p>"]

Sierra Totonac also marks the imperfective with a word-final <i>-y</i>, absent in other Totonacan languages. Other markers of Sierra Totonacan are lexical, though many of these words are shared with lowland Papantla Totonac.

The portal was developed out of dissatisfaction with the resources available to native speakers, the general public, and the academic community to learn about, study, and hear actual audio recordings (transcribed and translated) of the many native languages spoken in the Mesoamerican cultural area. Portal navigation to the resources is organized around two major themes or pathways: (1) Languages (accessed by clicking on the <a href='https://trusting-payne-054535.netlify.app/es/languageIndex'>Language Index</a>); and (2) Topics and media (accessed by clicking on the <a href='https://trusting-payne-054535.netlify.app/en/topicIndex'>Topic Index</a>). Mesolex is not only a hub for accessing resources but provides innovative tools for discovery and display of these resources. Particularly important are the language&#8209;specific back&#8209;end tools that will be created for all dictionaries (e.g., a finite state transducer, a thesaurus, and a multilanguage search tool) and the open&#8209;source program <a href='https://sylard-hsnrj.ondigitalocean.app/'>SYLARD</a>, an ELAN&#8209;to&#8209;HTML conversion tool for line&#8209;by&#8209;line playback of transcribed and translated digital audio. </p> <p> The Mesolex portal has been created with the support of a National Endowment for the Humanities, Office of Digital Humanities Level 1 grant (Award HAA&#8209;266482&#8209;19). Content has been provided by multiple individuals and sources, all credited on the relevant pages. Indeed, a major goal of Mesolex is to provide contributors, particularly native speakers documenting their own languages, a mechanism through which they can disseminate the material that they gather and edit (e.g., theses, articles, lexicons, and multimedia, including line&#8209;by&#8209;line audio playback). The ultimate goal of Mesolex is to create a platform that makes it easy for contributors to create language&#8209;specific “subportals” and for end users to access the material so deposited through either the language or topic index. Mesolex is not meant to be a permanent archive for long&#8209;term preservation but rather a portal to (1)&#160;facilitate discovery and access of materials archived elsewhere, and (2)&#160;develop metadata structures and content that can be exported and facilitate accession to permanent archives. Efforts are already underway to ensure that Mesolex materials (e.g., dictionaries, transcribed/translated audio) are also archived at institutions capable of long-term, secure preservation. In sum, the goal of Mesolex is to offer a language- and topically&#8209;organized lexicosemantic resource center for open access dissemination of lexicosemantic resources while at the same time providing a pathway for the permanent archiving of materials that are not published or otherwise permanently archived. The following two sections of this document present the two major pathways to materials accessible via Mesolex. </p> </div> </div> <div class='contenedor-columnas '> <div class='contenedor-4-col contenedor-titulo-estaticas '> <h1 class='titulo-estaticas' id='topic-index'>Topic Index</h1> </div> <div class='contenedor-8-col m-top-2rem '> <h2 class='titulo-estaticas'>Library</h2> <p>The library module is a link to files (for the most part pdfs) relevant a particular terminal language. Thus the subportal for the terminal language Yoloxóchitl Mixtec will include much published and unpublished material (e.g., conference presentations, an illustrated ethnobotanical guide) relevant to this language. All library materials are open access.</p> <h2 class='titulo-estaticas'>Videos</h2> <p>The video module is simply a catalogue with links to online videos (mostly posted on YouTube) relevant to any of the terminal languages represented in Mesolex. The administrator of each terminal language portal is free to select and create any links that he or she might wish. The Mesolex video module will integrate this into a searchable catalogue much as the Library module does with textual materials.</p> <h2 class='titulo-estaticas'>Audio: SYLARD</h2> <p>SYLARD (Synchronized Language Annotation Result Display) is <a href='https://sylard-hsnrj.ondigitalocean.app/source_code'>open-access software</a> that converts ELAN files (.eaf extensions) to HTML for line-by-line playback of the audio recordings. End users can configure the display in many ways, as explained in the SYLARD <a href='https://sylard-hsnrj.ondigitalocean.app/usermanual'>User Manual</a>, changing, for example, the language of the displayed translated texts (e.g., from Spanish to English, if the original ELAN file has both languages), or altering the display to a design that the user prefers.</p> <p>SYLARD has been developed to facilitate easy and direct native speaker, general public, and researcher access to language documentation material often not easily discoverable and invariably difficult to play for individuals not familiar with <a href='https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/elan'>ELAN</a> software. Under present archiving practices, users need to download an ELAN .eaf file, download the associated audio (.mp3 or .wav), install ELAN on a local computer, link the audio and transcription files in ELAN, and play back through the ELAN interface. This is a challenge for those not familiar with ELAN. SYLARD offers an easy alternative. Discovery of relevant materials in the Mesolex portal is facilitated by a <a href='https://sylard-hsnrj.ondigitalocean.app/catalog'>searchable catalogue</a> (with easy-to-create filters by, for example, language). Immediate line-by-line playback of the audio material can be achieved through any web browser. </p> <p>SYLARD can be accessed <a href='https://sylard-hsnrj.ondigitalocean.app/'>directly</a> or through the Mesolex <a href='https://mesolex-drako-iano9.ondigitalocean.app/en/topicIndex'>Audios</a> module. </p> <h2 class='titulo-estaticas'>Lexicons</h2> <p><b>Back-end search tools for Mesolex lexicons offer</b> an innovative approach to look-up in Indigenous language dictionaries. The tools address the following problems, each discussed in turn:</p> <ol class='lista-ordenada-estaticas'> <li>Linguistic and orthographic variation among closely related languages;</li> <li>Difficulty of discovery of Western language (usually Spanish or English) glosses;</li> <li> Searches across bilingual Indigenous language dictionaries that are written with different L2 languages. </li> </ol> <h3 class='titulo-estaticas'>1. Linguistic and orthographic variation</h3> <p>Linguistic and orthographic variations among closely related languages often complicate dictionary look-up for end users. For example, a native speaker of Nahuatl may enter a search for the headword <em>tlacatl</em> (‘man’) and be frustrated when no results are returned because the dictionary being searched spells this word <em>tla:katl</em> (with the length of the initial &#x3c;a&#x3e; marked as long via a colon, and the voiceless velar occlusive [k] written as &#x3c;k&#x3e;, not &#x3c;c&#x3e; as the user entered). These are <em> orthographic variations </em> that stymy look-up and discovery. Or, if the dictionary is of Highland Puebla Nahuatl, a user search for &#x3c;tlacatl&#x3e; would miss the cognate form &#x3c;ta:kat&#x3e;. Highland Puebla Nahuatl has lost &#x3c;tl&#x3e;, which is always realized as &#x3c;t&#x3e;. Concomitantly, a &#x3c;t&#x3e; in Highland Puebla Nahuatl may be realized as either &#x3c;t&#x3e; or &#x3c;tl&#x3e; in other Nahuatl languages. These are <em>linguistic variations</em> that stymy look-up and discovery. </p> <p>In general these two challenges to dictionary look-up (orthographic and linguistic) are addressed ad hoc by end users who must essentially work out how they need to change their search input. Mesolex integrates a solution that effectively removes much of the burden of look-up from end-users. To accomplish this Mesolex has integrated language-specific finite state transducers (FSTs) into its back-end. User-generated searches (e.g., for &#x3c;tlacatl&#x3e;) can be processed through these FSTs so that searches automatically discover many common orthographic and linguistic variations without any change to the search input. Mesolex has also integrated, into this same flexible search functionality, neutralization of certain language-specific phonemic distinctions. For example, searches in Nahuatl can ignore vowel length, searches in Mixtec can ignore tonal differences, searches in Mazatec and Totonac can ignore differences in phonation, and searches in Triqui can ignore the contrast between fortis and lenis consonants. All this flexibility is automatic as it is part of the language-specific FSTs that are built into the Mesolex back-end system.</p> <h3 class='titulo-estaticas'>2. Glosses</h3> <p>Users may also be frustrated when searches in the Western language, even for the most basic vocabulary, fail to find an Indigenous language equivalent. Often this is because of decisions made by the lexicographer during data entry. Thus a search for &#x3c;culebra&#x3e; might yield no hits simply because the entries for <i>ko¹o⁴</i> in Mixtec, <i>kowa:t</i> in Nahuatl, or <i>lu:w’a</i> in Totonac provide the gloss &#x3c;víbora&#x3e; or &#x3c;serpiente&#x3e; and not &#x3c;culebra&#x3e;. Mesolex has a back-end thesaurus (“word net”) that discovers synonyms and concatenates them into the search string. With this functionality, a user who actives the back-end thesaurus and looks for an Indigenous language entry for &#x3c;culebra&#x3e; will find all entries that have &#x3c;culebra&#x3e;, &#x3c;víbora&#x3e;, &#x3c;serpiente&#x3e;, or any other synonym. Or a search for &#x3c;contemplate&#x3e; would find the Indigenous words glossed as &#x3c;think&#x3e;, &#x3c;ponder&#x3e;, or other semantically similar words that might be in the back-end thesaurus.</p> <h3 class='titulo-estaticas'>3. Bilingual searches</h3> <p>Finally, it is often the case that users might want to search across several dictionaries, some of which might use different languages (basically Spanish and English) for the glosses and translations. Mesolex will also develop a built-in (back-end) bilingual dictionary that can be activated to search across target languages. Thus, for example, a search for &#x3c;cat&#x3e; will find &#x3c;gato&#x3e; and a search for &#x3c;perro&#x3e; will find &#x3c;dog&#x3e; in the glosses, definitions, or translations of illustrative phrases.</p> <p> The three aforementioned search enhancements (finite state transducer, thesaurus, bilingual equivalences) facilitate discovery of both Indigenous language headwords (by those who may use different orthographies or speak different language variants) and target language glosses or translations. </p> <h2 class='titulo-estaticas'>Flora and Fauna</h2> <p>The Flora and Fauna module is an ebook in development of ethnobiological knowledge. The prototype version presently in Mesolex is limited to ethnobotanical knowledge in a wide range of communities in central Mexico.</p> <p> Note that the illustrated ethnobotanical guides can be accessed either by a terminal language subportal or by keyword in the Library module. For example, the illustrated ethnobotanical guide for Yoloxóchitl can be found through the Yoloxóchitl Mixtec subportal or, easier, by a filter (e.g., ‘ethnototany) in the Library module. </p> </div> </div> <div class='contenedor-columnas '> <div class='contenedor-4-col contenedor-titulo-estaticas '> <h1 class='titulo-estaticas ' id='language-index'>Language Index</h1> </div> <div class='contenedor-8-col m-top-2rem' id='about-ultimo'> <h2 class='titulo-estaticas'>Overview</h2> <p>The <a href='https://trusting-payne-054535.netlify.app/en/languageIndex'>Language Index</a> is another way to find Mesolex resources. In this pathway a user first accesses the Language group module (e.g., Amuzgoan, Maya, Mazatec, Mixe, etc.), which is a high-level taxonomic node in a phylogenetic language tree. The exact node that has been chosen for Mesolex is in some sense arbitrary. Thus Amuzgo-Mixtecan is not represented but rather slightly lower-level nodes such as Amuzgoan, Mixtec, and Triqui (Cuicatec might be added at some point, or Mixtec changed to Mixtec-Cuicatec). Once the user clicks on a language group, they are taken to a list of what may be referred to as “terminal languages”. For example, the <a href='https://trusting-payne-054535.netlify.app/en/languageIndexView/mixtec'> Mixtec language group </a> comprises 4 terminal languages plus “Historical Mixtec (proto-Mixtec)”. Finally, by clicking on any one of the terminal languages, the user is taken to a terminal language page such as that for San Pedro Amuzgos Amuzgo depicted below.</p> <h4 class='titulo-estaticas'>Example terminal language page</h4> <img class='imagen-estaticas-columna-grande' src='/generals/about/pantalla-emergente-about-en.jpg' alt='Example terminal language page'> <p>As clear from the above screenshot, the footer of terminal language pages presents the Topic modules as they appear in the Topic Index. Accessing the resources through the terminal language page in effect simply filters all resources so that only those pertinent to the language being researched appear when the topical links are clicked. Thus clicking on Library will present all library resources that have been filtered to display only those pertinent to the relevant terminal language page.</p> <p> Finally, for all terminal language pages there is an administrator, often a researcher working on that particular language, who selects the content for the subportal. This individual or individuals are credited along with any institutional support (e.g., a funding agency) that might have helped gather the resources presented. Each terminal language, therefore, will have distinct credits, accessible by clicking on the Credits link in red. </p> </div> </div> </main>"
